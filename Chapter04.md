The text mentions (p. 26) <img src="/tex/3735a5ae406553dd36c7eaa53209496f.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=32.94528269999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/> as an example of a canonical expression,
yet canonical expressions are defined to be closed and _saturated_.

It might seem that <img src="/tex/3735a5ae406553dd36c7eaa53209496f.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=32.94528269999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/> is _not_ saturated,
but the notation in the book uses a different notation for the syntactic notion of the function,
and in this particular case the actual unsaturated function would have been written as <img src="/tex/57e527c4bb269457e366725054576297.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=31.575409799999992pt height=24.65753399999998pt/>.

<img src="/tex/fd8be73b54f5436a5cd2e73ba9b6bfa9.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.58908224999999pt height=22.831056599999986pt/> is best viewed as a primitive canonical constant (or like a `newtype`-introduced constructor in Haskell),
and, in fact, the book explicitly defines it this way around pp. 48-49.
