*Errata* (sort of)

* P. 92, judgements (14.15-17):
looks like it should be $z(v) \in \text{Set}(C(s'(v)))$
instead of $z(v) \in C(s'(v))$ in the contexts
(otherwise it doesn't make sense from the types point of view).

* P. 101, middle of the page: looks like we need $\mathbb{N} + \mathbb{N}$ as the set of constructors, not $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$.
